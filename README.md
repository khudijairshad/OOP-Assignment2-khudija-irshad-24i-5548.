Question 1: Recursion
File name: Q1_Recursion.cpp
This program performs two tasks using recursion.
The first function, ChangeLocation, takes a character array and two index positions, then swaps the elements between these positions recursively.
The second function, PrintPattern, prints a numeric pattern where each line follows a simple structure based on the given number. Both parts show how recursion can replace loops for repetitive tasks.


Question 2: Singly Linked List
File name: Q2_SinglyLinkedList.cpp
This program simulates NASA’s Earth Observation system using object-oriented programming and linked lists.
It defines a base class called Feature and two derived classes, LandFeature and WaterFeature. Each class has an analyze function that prints out the type of feature detected.
A singly linked list stores nodes containing a feature ID and a pointer to a Feature object. The program allows inserting new features, deleting features by ID, displaying all features, and reversing the list order.


Question 3: Doubly Linked List
File name: Q3_DoublyLinkedList.cpp
This program represents a simple library system using a doubly linked list.
Each node contains the book’s ID, title, and author.
It includes functions to add books at the beginning or end of the list, delete books by ID, and display all books both forward and backward. The program shows how doubly linked lists allow movement in both directions efficiently.


Question 4: Queue
File name: Q4_Queue.cpp
This program models a ticket booking system using a queue.
Each customer in the queue has an ID, name, and number of tickets requested.
The program adds new customers to the end of the queue and removes them from the front in First In First Out (FIFO) order. It also displays the current queue. The program demonstrates how queues are used in real-life scenarios like serving customers in order.


Question 5: Stack
File name: Q5_Stack.cpp
This program implements two types of stacks: one using a linked list and the other using a dynamic array.
Both stacks support basic operations like push, pop, and peek.
The linked-list-based stack uses nodes connected by pointers, while the array-based stack uses an index to track the top element.
At the end, the program compares both implementations in terms of time efficiency and memory use.
Insertion and deletion in both are O(1) operations, but linked lists use more memory because of extra pointers.


Each question is written in a separate C++ file.
Open any file in your IDE or compiler, run it, and observe the output.
You can change input values in main to test different cases.
